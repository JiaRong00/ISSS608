    "section": "",
    "text": "Overview\nWhen telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, we will create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages.\nAt the same time, we will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n1.1 Basic concepts of animation\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n1.2 Terminology\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n2 Getting Started\nWe first install the required R packages & load the dataset\n\nLoad Dataset\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Data worksheet from GlobalPopulation Excel workbook will be used.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(col, as.factor) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\nInstead of using mutate_at(), across() can be used to derive the same outputs.\n\ncol &lt;- c(\"Country\", \"Continent\")\nglobalPop &lt;- read_xls(\"data/GlobalPopulation.xls\",\n                      sheet=\"Data\") %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(col, as.factor)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Year = as.integer(Year))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Animated Data Visualisation: gganimate methods\ngganimate extends the grammar of graphics as implemented by ggplot2 to include the description of animation. It does this by providing a range of new grammar classes that can be added to the plot object in order to customise how it should change with time.\n\ntransition_*() defines how the data should be spread out and how it relates to itself across time.\nview_*() defines how the positional scales should change along the animation.\nshadow_*() defines how data from other points in time should be presented in the given point in time.\nenter_*()/exit_*() defines how new data should appear and how old data should disappear during the course of the animation.\nease_aes() defines how different aesthetics should be eased during transitions.\n\n\nBuilding a static population bubble plot\nIn the code chunk below, the basic ggplot2 functions are used to create a static bubble plot.\n\nggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the animated bubble plot\n\ntransition_time() of gganimate is used to create transition through distinct states in time (i.e. Year).\nease_aes() is used to control easing of aesthetics. The default is linear. Other methods are: quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, sine, circular, exponential, elastic, back, and bounce.\ntransition_reveal() can be used to let data gradually appear across axis\n\n\nTransition with timeWith facet wrapTransition reveal\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np&lt;- ggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(title = 'Year: {frame_time}', \n       x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_time(Year) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')   \n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np + facet_wrap(~Continent)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np2&lt;- ggplot(globalPop, aes(x = Old, y = Young, \n                      size = Population, \n                      colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') +\n  transition_reveal(Old) +       \n  ease_aes('linear')   \n\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Animated Data Visualisation: plotly\nIn Plotly R package, both ggplotly() and plot_ly() support key frame animations through the frame argument/aesthetic. They also support an ids argument/aesthetic to ensure smooth transitions between objects with the same id (which helps facilitate object constancy).\n\n4.1 Building an animated bubble plot: ggplotly() method\nThe animated bubble plot below includes a play/pause button and a slider component for controlling the animation\n\n\nShow the code\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7, \n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that although show.legend = FALSE argument was used, the legend still appears on the plot. To overcome this problem, theme(legend.position='none') should be used as shown in the plot and code chunk below.\n\n\nShow the code\ngg &lt;- ggplot(globalPop, \n       aes(x = Old, \n           y = Young, \n           size = Population, \n           colour = Country)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = Population,\n                 frame = Year),\n             alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = country_colors) +\n  scale_size(range = c(2, 12)) +\n  labs(x = '% Aged', \n       y = '% Young') + \n  theme(legend.position='none')\n\nggplotly(gg)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Building an animated bubble plot: plot_ly() method\n\n\nShow the code\nbp &lt;- globalPop %&gt;%\n  plot_ly(x = ~Old, \n          y = ~Young, \n          size = ~Population, \n          color = ~Continent,\n          sizes = c(2, 100),\n          frame = ~Year, \n          text = ~Country, \n          hoverinfo = \"text\",\n          type = 'scatter',\n          mode = 'markers'\n          ) %&gt;%\n  layout(showlegend = FALSE)\nbp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 References\n\nGetting Started\nBuilding an animation step-by-step with gganimate\nCreating a composite gif with multiple gganimate panels",

    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Overview\nIn this exercise, we will be using ggplot2 extensions to create more elegant and effective statistical graphics. The goal of this exercise is to:\n\ncontrol the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in ggrepel package,\ncreate professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in ggthemes and hrbrthemes packages,\nplot composite figure by combining ggplot2 graphs by using patchwork package.\n\n\n\n2 Getting Started\n\nLoad PackagesImport Dataset\n\n\nIn this exercise, beside tidyverse, four R packages will be used. They are:\n\nggrepel: an R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.\nggthemes: an R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ‘ggplot2’.\nhrbrthemes: an R package provides typography-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.\npatchwork: an R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.\n\n\npacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork, \n               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,\n               tidyverse) \n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Beyond ggplot2 Annotation: ggrepel\nOne of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label(aes(label = ID), \n             hjust = .5, \n             vjust = -.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggrepel is an extension of ggplot2 package which provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text as in our example above.\nWe simply replace geom_text() by geom_text_repel() and geom_label() by geom_label_repel.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID), \n                   fontface = \"bold\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Beyond ggplot2 Themes\nggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes, they are: theme_gray(), theme_bw(), theme_classic(), theme_dark(), theme_light(), theme_linedraw(), theme_minimal(), and theme_void().\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  theme_gray() +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Working with ggtheme package\nggthemes provides ‘ggplot2’ themes that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tufte, Stephen Few, Fivethirtyeight, The Economist, ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and The Wall Street Journal, among others.\nIn the example below, The Economist theme is used.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Working with hrbthems package\nhrbrthemes package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used. The second goal centers around productivity for a production workflow. In fact, this “production workflow” is the context for where the elements of hrbrthemes should be used.\n\nDefaultChanging Theme Settings\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naxis_title_size argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18,\nbase_size argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15, and\ngrid argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\") +\n  theme_ipsum(axis_title_size = 18,\n              base_size = 15,\n              grid = \"Y\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Beyond Single Graph\nIt is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, we will create composite plot by combining multiple graphs. First, create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.\n\nMath ScoresEnglish ScoresScatter Plot\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") + \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Maths scores\")\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of English scores\")\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np3 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x= MATHS, \n                 y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\np3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Creating Composite Graphics: pathwork methods\nThere are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as grid.arrange() of gridExtra package and plot_grid() of cowplot package. In this section, we will use an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /.\n\n\n\n5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork.\n\ntwo columntwo row\n\n\n\np1+p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1/p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6 References\n\nPatchwork R package goes nerd viral\nggrepel\nggthemes\nhrbrthemes\nggplot tips: Arranging plots\nggplot2 Theme Elements Demonstration\nggplot2 Theme Elements Reference Sheet",

It defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nThe figure below shows the seven grammars of ggplot2\n\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.\n\n\n\n5 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: data\nLet us call the ggplot() function using the code chunk below\n\nggplot(data=exam_data)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nA blank canvas appears.\nggplot() initializes a ggplot object.\nThe data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.\nIf the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().\n\n\n\n\n\n6 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Aesthetic mappings\nThe aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency. Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.\nAll aesthetics of a plot are specified in the aes() function call.\nThe code chunk below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\n\n\n7 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: geom\nGeometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot. Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts) geom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map\n\n\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator. -For complete list, please refer to here\n\n\n7.1 geom_bar\nThe code chunk below plots a bar chart by using geom_bar()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2 geom_dotplot\nIn a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_dotplot() of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(dotsize = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe warned\n\n\n\nggplot includes the x-axis and the axis’s label.\n\n\nThe code chunk below performs the following two steps: - scale_y_continuous() is used to turn off the y-axis, and - binwidth argument is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,         \n               dotsize = 0.5) +      \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,           \n                     breaks = NULL)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3 geom_histogram()\nIn the code chunk below, geom_histogram() is used to create a simple histogram by using values in MATHS field of exam_data.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram()       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the default bin is 30.\n\n\n\n\n7.4 Modifying a geometric object by changing geom()\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nbins argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,\nfill argument is used to shade the histogram with light blue color, and\ncolor argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars in black\n\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20,            \n                 color=\"black\",      \n                 fill=\"light blue\")  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.5 Modifying a geometric object by changing aes()\nThe code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. fill) by using sub-group of aesthetic(). This approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 color=\"grey30\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.6 geom-density()\ngeom-density() computes and plots kernel density estimate, which is a smoothed version of the histogram.\nIt is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using colour or fill arguments of aes()\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.7 geom_boxplot\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all “outlying” points individually.\nThe code chunk below plots boxplots by using geom_boxplot().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS,       \n           x= GENDER)) +    \n  geom_boxplot()            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotches are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.\nThe code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.8 geom_violin\ngeom_violin is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it’s easier to compare several distributions since they’re placed side by side.\nThe code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.9 geom_point()\ngeom_point() is especially useful for creating scatterplot.\nThe code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point()     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.10 geom objects can be combined\nThe code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both geom_boxplot() and geom_point().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, \n           x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +                    \n  geom_point(position=\"jitter\", \n             size = 0.5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: stat\nThe Statistics functions statistically transform data, usually as some form of summary. For example:\n\nfrequency of values of a variable (bar graph)\n\na mean\na confidence limit\n\nThere are two ways to use these functions:\n\nadd a stat_() function and override the default geom, or\nadd a geom_() function and override the default stat.\n\n\n\n8.1 Working with stat()\nThe boxplots below are incomplete because the positions of the means were not shown.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2 Working with stat - the stat_summary() method\nThe code chunk below adds mean values by using stat_summary() function and overriding the default geom.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour =\"red\",        \n               size=4)               \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3 Working with stat - the geom() method\nThe code chunk below adding mean values by using geom_() function and overriding the default stat.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(y = MATHS, x= GENDER)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  geom_point(stat=\"summary\",        \n             fun=\"mean\",           \n             colour=\"red\",          \n             size=4)          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4 Adding a best fit curve on a scatterplot?\nThe scatterplot below shows the relationship of Maths and English grades of pupils. The interpretability of this graph can be improved by adding a best fit curve.\nIn the code chunk below, geom_smooth() is used to plot a best fit curve on the scatterplot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default method used is loess.\n\n\nThe default smoothing method can be overridden as shown below.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, \n           y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              linewidth=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Facets\nFacetting generates small multiples (sometimes also called trellis plot), each displaying a different subset of the data. They are an alternative to aesthetics for displaying additional discrete variables. ggplot2 supports two types of factes, namely: facet_grid() and facet_wrap.\n\n9.1 Working with facet_wrap()\nfacet_wrap wraps a 1d sequence of panels into 2d. This is generally a better use of screen space than facet_grid because most displays are roughly rectangular.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet-wrap().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_wrap(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2 facet_grid() function\nfacet_grid() forms a matrix of panels defined by row and column facetting variables. It is most useful when you have two discrete variables, and all combinations of the variables exist in the data.\nThe code chunk below plots a trellis plot using facet_grid().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20) +\n    facet_grid(~ CLASS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Coordinates\nThe Coordinates functions map the position of objects onto the plane of the plot. There are a number of different possible coordinate systems to use, they are:\n\ncoord_cartesian(): the default cartesian coordinate systems, where you specify x and y values (e.g. allows you to zoom in or out).\ncoord_flip(): a cartesian system with the x and y flipped.\ncoord_fixed(): a cartesian system with a “fixed” aspect ratio (e.g. 1.78 for a “widescreen” plot).\ncoord_quickmap(): a coordinate system that approximates a good aspect ratio for maps.\n\n\n10.1 Working with Coordinate\nBy default, the bar chart of ggplot2 is in vertical form.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below flips the horizontal bar chart into vertical bar chart by using coord_flip().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.2 Changing the y- and x-axis range\nThe scatterplot on the right is slightly misleading because the y-aixs and x-axis range are not equal.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, size=0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below fixed both the y-axis and x-axis range from 0-100.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x= MATHS, y=ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method=lm, \n              size=0.5) +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: themes\nThemes control elements of the graph not related to the data. For example:\n\nbackground colour\nsize of fonts\ngridlines\ncolour of labels\n\nBuilt-in themes include: - theme_gray() (default) - theme_bw() - theme_classic()\nA list of theme can be found at this link. Each theme element can be conceived of as either a line (e.g. x-axis), a rectangle (e.g. graph background), or text (e.g. axis title).\n\n11.1 Working with theme\nThe code chunk below plot a horizontal bar chart using theme_gray().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_gray()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_classic().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_classic()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA horizontal bar chart plotted using theme_minimal().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x=RACE)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12 References\n\nHadley Wickham (2023) ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.

    "text": "1 Learning Outcome\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n2 Getting Started\n\nLoading LibrariesImporting Dataset\n\n\nWe will install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\nIn this exercise, we will be using the exam data\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides.\n\n3.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package.\nThe graph is generated in 2 steps. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\nAdditional features:\n\nopts_zoom: When zoom_max (maximum zoom factor) is set to a value greater than 1, a toolbar will appear to enable zoom view.\n\n\nDefaultEnabling Zoom-ins\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.1;\")\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID, data_id = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.1;\"),\n    opts_zoom(max = 5)\n))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip in the dataset. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field. Next, this newly created field is used as tooltip field as shown in the code of line 7.

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\n\nby using plot_ly(), and\nby using ggplotly()\n\n\n4.1 Creating an interactive scatter plot: plot_ly() method\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly()\nNotice that in the plot, labels are shown when the mouse hovers over a point, without needing to specify unlike in the examples above using tooltip with the ggiraph package\n\n\nShow the code\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\nIn the code chunk below, color argument is mapped to a qualitative visual variable (i.e. RACE).\n\n\nShow the code\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Creating an interactive scatter plot: ggplotly() method\nThe code chunk below plots an interactive scatter plot by using ggplotly().\n\n\nShow the code\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Coordinated Multiple Views with plotly\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\n\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data.\ntwo scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions.\nlastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 Interactive Data Visualisation - crosstalk methods!\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n5.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package\n\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Linked brushing: crosstalk method\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhighlight_key(): create a unique identifier for each row in a data frame, based on its values. The resulting identifier is used to keep track of the rows that have been selected or highlighted on a plot, particularly when using the highlight() function.\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side.\ncrosstalk::bscols(): creates a Bootstrap column layout. The first argument is the left column, and the second argument is the right column. The widths argument is used to specify the relative width of the two columns, with the default value being 6 for both.\n\n\n\n\n6 References\n\n6.1 ggiraph\nThis link provides online version of the reference guide and several useful articles.

    "title": "Hands-on Exercise 04a: Visualising Distribution",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Learning Outcome\nVisualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we shared some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we will explore two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n2 Getting Started\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the Exam_data.csv dataset and the following R packages will be used:\n\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,\nggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and\ncolorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\n\nLoading PackagesImporting Dataset\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 Visualising Distribution with Ridgeline Plot\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n3.1 Plotting ridgeline graph: ggridges method\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, we will plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.2 Varying fill colors along the x axis\nTo have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis, we can use either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient().\nBoth geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, we will create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n4.1 Plotting a Half Eye graph\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Adding the boxplot with geom_boxplot()\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Adding the Dot Plots with stat_dots()\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.4 Finishing Touch\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\n\nShow the code\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 References\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

It can be interpreted as a measure of the strength of evidence in favor of one theory among two competing theories.\nThat’s because the Bayes factor gives us a way to evaluate the data in favor of a null hypothesis, and to use external information to do so. It tells us what the weight of the evidence is in favor of a given hypothesis.\nWhen we are comparing two hypotheses, H1 (the alternate hypothesis) and H0 (the null hypothesis), the Bayes Factor is often written as B10.\n\n\n\n3.3 Two-sample mean test: ggbetweenstats()\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for two-sample mean test of Maths scores by gender.\nWe can change the colors by specifying package (package from which color palette is to be taken) and palette.\n\nDefaultChanging color palette\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE,\n  package = \"ggsci\",\n  palette = \"nrc_npg\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApart from being able to change the color palattes,\n\nThe type (of test) argument also accepts the following abbreviations: “p” (for parametric), “np” (for nonparametric), “r” (for robust), “bf” (for Bayes Factor).\nThe type of plot to be displayed can also be modified (“box”, “violin”, or “boxviolin”). The default is boxviolin\n\n\nBoxViolin\n\n\nviolin.args can be modified to remove the violin\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE,\n  # to remove violin plot\n  violin.args = list(width = 0)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nboxplot.args can be modified to remove the boxplot\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = GENDER, \n  y = MATHS,\n  type = \"np\",\n  messages = FALSE,\n  # to remove box plot\n  boxplot.args = list(width = 0)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Oneway ANOVA Test: ggbetweenstats() method\nIn the code chunk below, ggbetweenstats() is used to build a visual for One-way ANOVA test on English score by race.\n\npairwise.display has three options, ‘ns’: shows only non-signififcant, ‘s’: shows only significant, ‘all’: displays all pairwise comparisons\np.adjust.method determines the method for adjusting p-values for multiple tests\n\n\n\nShow the code\nggbetweenstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = RACE, \n  y = ENGLISH,\n  type = \"p\",\n  mean.ci = TRUE, \n  pairwise.comparisons = TRUE, \n  pairwise.display = \"s\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"fdr\",\n  messages = FALSE\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Significant Test of Correlation: ggscatterstats()\nIn the code chunk below, ggscatterstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Correlation between Maths scores and English scores.\n\n\nShow the code\nggscatterstats(\n  data = exam,\n  x = MATHS,\n  y = ENGLISH,\n  marginal = FALSE,\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Significant Test of Association (Depedence) : ggbarstats() methods\nIn the code chunk below, the Maths scores is binned into a 4-class variable by using cut().\n\nexam1 &lt;- exam %&gt;% \n  mutate(MATHS_bins = \n           cut(MATHS, \n               breaks = c(0,60,75,85,100))\n)\n\nIn this code chunk below ggbarstats() is used to build a visual for Significant Test of Association\n\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER\n           )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo change the display of percentages to include decimal points, we can modify the digits.perc argument\n\nggbarstats(exam1, \n           x = MATHS_bins, \n           y = GENDER,\n           digits.perc = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4 Visualising Models\nIn this section, we will visualise model diagnostic and model parameters by using parameters package.\nThe Toyota Corolla case study will be used.

According to findings of research studies, heart attacks are increasingly common in young adults (aged 40 or below) 1. The alarming trend highlights a need to understand the potential causes and risk factors of early heart attacks and the differences in the profiles of young adult heart attack patients from older patients to enable early detection and enforcement of preventive measures.\n\n\n1.2 Dataset\nIn this exercise, we have obtained a dataset on heart attack incidents in Japan from Kaggle, consisting of data on heart attack victims aged 18 to 79.\n\n\n1.3 Objectives\nUsing the Japan heart attack dataset, we aim to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights on:\n\n\n\n2 Getting Started\n\n2.1 Loading Packages\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse)\n\n\n\n2.2 Importing Data\nThe dataset used in this exercise is the japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv file downloaded from Kaggle.

Of which, there are 17 relevant variables and 15 extra column variables which are irrelevant to our analysis.\nIn addition, by viewing the first few entries of each column, we can see that there are both categorical and continuous variables in the dataset.\nWith a focus on the 17 relevant variables, a data dictionary table is generated, showing the range for the 7 continuous variables and the unique values for the 10 categorical variables.\n\nImport dataGlimpse dataData dictionary\n\n\n\nheart_attack &lt;- read_csv(\"data/japan_heart_attack_dataset.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nglimpse(heart_attack)\n\nRows: 30,000\nColumns: 32\n$ Age                     &lt;dbl&gt;

    "text": "1 Overview\nFunnel plot is a specially designed data visualisation for conducting unbiased comparison between outlets, stores or business entities. By the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting funnel plots by using funnelPlotR package,\nplotting static funnel plot by using ggplot2 package, and\nplotting interactive funnel plot by using both plotly R and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\n\n2 Getting Started\nIn this exercise, the following R packages will be used:\n\nreadr for importing csv into R.\nFunnelPlotR for creating funnel plot.\nggplot2 for creating funnel plot manually.\nknitr for building static html table.\nplotly for creating interactive funnel plot.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta dataset downloaded from Open Data Covid-19 Provinsi DKI Jakarta portal to compare the cumulative COVID-19 cases and death by sub-district (i.e. kelurahan) as at 31st July 2021, DKI Jakarta.\n\nLoading PackagesImporting dataset\n\n\n\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, FunnelPlotR, plotly, knitr)\n\n\n\n\ncovid19 &lt;- read_csv(\"data/COVID-19_DKI_Jakarta.csv\") %&gt;%\n  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 FunnelPlotR methods\nFunnelPlotR package uses ggplot to generate funnel plots. It requires a numerator (events of interest), denominator (population to be considered) and group. The key arguments selected for customisation are:\n\nlimit: plot limits (95 or 99).\nlabel_outliers: to label outliers (true or false).\nPoisson_limits: to add Poisson limits to the plot.\nOD_adjust: to add overdispersed limits to the plot.\nxrange and yrange: to specify the range to display for axes, acts like a zoom function.\nOther aesthetic components such as graph title, axis labels etc.\n\n\n3.1 FunnelPlotR methods\nThe code chunk below plots a funnel plot.\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Positive,\n  denominator = Death,\n  group = `Sub-district`\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 0 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\nNote: group in this function is different from the scatterplot. Here, it defines the level of the points to be plotted i.e. Sub-district, District or City. If Cityc is chosen, there are only six data points.\n\n\n3.2 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 1\nIn the code chunk below,\n\ndata_type argument is used to change from default “SR” (standardised ratios) to “PR” (proportions)\nxrange and yrange are used to set the range of x-axis and y-axis\n\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Death,\n  denominator = Positive,\n  group = `Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",    \n  xrange = c(0, 6500),  \n  yrange = c(0, 0.05)   \n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n3.3 FunnelPlotR methods: Makeover 2\nIn the code chunk below,\n\nlabel = NA argument is to removed the default label outliers feature.\ntitle argument is used to add plot title.\nx_label and y_label arguments are used to add/edit x-axis and y-axis titles.\n\n\nfunnel_plot(\n  .data = covid19,\n  numerator = Death,\n  denominator = Positive,\n  group = `Sub-district`,\n  data_type = \"PR\",   \n  xrange = c(0, 6500),  \n  yrange = c(0, 0.05),\n  label = NA,\n  title = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Fatality Rate by Cumulative Total Number of COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #&lt;&lt;           \n  x_label = \"Cumulative COVID-19 Positive Cases\", #&lt;&lt;\n  y_label = \"Cumulative Fatality Rate\"  #&lt;&lt;\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA funnel plot object with 267 points of which 7 are outliers. \nPlot is adjusted for overdispersion. \n\n\n\n\n\n4 Funnel Plot for Fair Visual Comparison: ggplot2 methods\nIn this section, we will build funnel plots step-by-step by using ggplot2, to enhance working experience of ggplot2 to customise speciallised data visualisation like funnel plot.\n\n4.1 Computing the basic derived fields\nTo plot the funnel plot from scratch, we need to derive cumulative death rate and standard error of cumulative death rate.\n\ndf &lt;- covid19 %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate = Death / Positive) %&gt;%\n  mutate(rate.se = sqrt((rate*(1-rate)) / (Positive))) %&gt;%\n  filter(rate &gt;
