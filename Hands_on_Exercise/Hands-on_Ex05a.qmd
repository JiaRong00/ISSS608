### **1 Overview**

Ternary plots are a way of displaying the distribution and variability of three-part compositional data. (For example, the proportion of aged, economy active and young population or sand, silt, and clay in soil.) Itâ€™s display is a triangle with sides scaled from 0 to 1. Each side represents one of the three components. A point is plotted so that a line drawn perpendicular from the point to each leg of the triangle intersect at the component values of the point.
